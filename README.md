# Prediction

## Goals

* Discuss different uses for prediction algorithms in education
* Discuss the theory behind the CART, C4.5 and C5 classification algorithms
* Construct classification models to predict student dropout and state validation metrics for the model
* Compare classification models on appropriate metrics
